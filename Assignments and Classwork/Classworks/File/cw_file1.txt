Assume that each of the following statements applies to the same program.

a) Write a statement that opens file oldmast.dat for input; use an ifstream object called
inOldMaster.

c) Write a statement that opens file newmast.dat for output (and creation); use ofstream
object outNewMaster.

d) Write a statement that reads a record (or line) from the file oldmast.dat. The record consists of
integer accountNumber, string name and floating-point currentBalance; use ifstream
object inOldMaster.

f) Write a statement that writes a record (or line) to the file newmast.dat. The record consists of
integer accountNum, string name, and floating-point currentBalance; use ofstream object
outNewMaster.
